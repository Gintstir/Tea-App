## **Description**

This app has a robust back end for compressing and storing images.  It also leverages features of Mongoose, graphql, and apollo for lightining fast server response times for getting and fetching data.  We use bCrypt for hashing and salting sensitive personal data like passwords while JWT's create a secure link between the user and our back-end.  On the front-end, grommet and materialize work in tandem with React to provide the user with a smooth, visually appealing experience.
